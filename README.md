# flow-name_mapper-test

Testing import of MP3 file
and getting [Flow](https://flow.org)
to like it.

Flow has a
[module.name_mapper option](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/options/#toc-module-name-mapper-regex-string)
that, from what I've read,
should handle this situation.

## Installation

1. Clone repository
2. `yarn install`

## Usage

To run [Flow](https://flow.org):

1. `yarn flow`

To see the app running:

1. `yarn start`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:1337 in a browser
